% NOTES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
% *has been tested extensively only when superstrate and substrate have equal 
%     epsilon and thickness
% 
% *the lengths (a,d) and inverse lengths (k0,kpar) must be set in the same
%  units (e.g. microns and inverse microns, respectively)
%
% *halfnpw = 0 sets the number of harmonic waves to 1, e.g. the scattering
%  matrix reduces to the ordinary 4x4 formalism for unpatterned multilayers
