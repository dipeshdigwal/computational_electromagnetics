% NOTES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% *the lengths (a,d) and inverse lengths (k0,kpar) must be set in the same
%  units (e.g. microns and inverse microns, respectively)
%
% *epssup must be real (otherwise the incident waves are ill-defined)
%
% *E fields are complex. 
%  The real, time-dependent fields are Re(E*exp(-i omega t)) [omega = c*k0]
