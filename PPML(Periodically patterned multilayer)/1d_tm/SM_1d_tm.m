%
%  The coefficients connect the amplitudes of the Hy fields, calculated at the interface between 
%   superstrate and first internal layer, or substrate and last internal layer.
%
% rl             -> reflection coefficient from superstrate to superstrate ("left reflectance")
% rr             -> reflection coefficient from substrate to substrate ("right reflectance")
% tlr            -> transmission coefficient from superstrate to substrate ("left to right")
% trl            -> transmission coefficient from substrate to superstrate ("right to left")

% NOTES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
% *has been tested extensively only when superstrate and substrate have equal 
%     epsilon and thickness
% 
% *the lengths (a,d) and inverse lengths (k0,kpar) must be set in the same
%  units (e.g. microns and inverse microns, respectively)
%
% *halfnpw = 0 sets the number of harmonic waves to 1, e.g. the scattering
%  matrix reduces to the ordinary 2x2 formalism for unpatterned multilayers
