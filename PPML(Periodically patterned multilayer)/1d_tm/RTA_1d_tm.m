% NOTES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% *the lengths (a,d) and inverse lengths (k0,kpar) must be set in the same
%  units (e.g. microns and inverse microns, respectively)
%
% *epssup must be real (otherwise the incident waves are ill-defined)
% 
% *epssub can be either real or complex. 
%  In the first case, TT is the transmittance towards the far field.
%  In the second case, TT is the absorbance in the substrate...
%
% *Above diffraction thresholds, RR and TT contain also the contribution of
% diffracted beams
%
% *halfnpw = 0 sets the number of harmonic waves to 1, e.g. the scattering
%  matrix reduces to the ordinary 2x2 formalism for unpatterned multilayers
%
% *thickness of superstrate and substrate do not influence the result.
%  in effect, super- and substrate are semi-infinite.
